### Link

- Live Site URL: [QR Code Component](https://qr-code-component-one-sable.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

Figma file certainly made things easier as I could get the exact colour easily. Getting the correct position was a struggle but I finally succeeded.

```css
.box {
    display: block;
    position: absolute;
}

img {
    position: relative;
}

.text-box {
    display: block;
    position: relative;
}
```

I also learned how to deploy a website using vercel. It too some trial & error but I was finally able to do it.

### Continued development

I still need to practice the positioning an element more. I also need to learn about CSS in general & HTML5 rules.
