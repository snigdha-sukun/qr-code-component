## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

Figma file certainly made things easier as I could get the exact colour easily. Getting the correct position was a struggle but I finally succeeded.


```css
.box {
    display: block;
    position: absolute;
}

img {
    position: relative;
}

.text-box {
    display: block;
    position: relative;
}
```

### Continued development

I still need to practice the positioning an element more.
